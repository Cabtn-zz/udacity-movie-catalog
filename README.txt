Project Title: Movie Catalog

Project Purpose: Organize your movies by genre using this CRUD app.

Description: A simple tool to navigate between different movie genres and view movies in their respective genre.

Setup: To get started please make sure you have the Udacity Vagrant Running and run db_setup.py to instantiate a few categories. From there you can run webserver.py and will can navigate to your local host.

Usage: Localhost:8000 will land you on the root page of the app where you will see the available categories. If you wish you add/modify your own contributions to the app you will need to log in using our secure google oath service. 

In the future we will be including additional categories and ways to log in. We will also be styling the app shortly too.

To contribute please create a Pull Request outline the changes you would love to incorporate and tag me as a reviewer @Cabtn.

Thanks!
